Koiratreffit-app

Overview

the koiratreffit-app (dog date in english) idea started with me getting my first puppy and trying to find suitable friends for her to play with - not easy. I decided to fix this problem by designing and creating an app where dog owners can connect and plan play dates for their dogs.

Used technologies

Backend: Java 21 with SpringBoot, unit tests using Junit
Frontend: planned to use React.js, Redux for state management. BootStrap for design?
Database: MongoDB
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
